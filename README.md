# EmbeddedSystems-LightSensorControl
<p align="justify">This is an Arduino code that reads a light sensor connected to pin A5 using the ADC (analog to digital converter) in free-running mode with auto-trigger enable. The code also controls an LED connected to pin PC7 using timer A channel 4 in PWM (pulse width modulation) mode. The duty cycle of the PWM signal is controlled by the ADC value, which is converted to a duty cycle value in the range of 0 to 255. The LED controlled by the pin PC7 is used to show the strength of the light targeted at thelight sensor by dimming based on light strength. The loop function includes a 10 ms delay to avoid excessive readings.</p>
